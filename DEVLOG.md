Ahh... whole day just for me...

At this point I have not made anything with swift yet, I just did this hour long tutorial on Swift fundamentals over 4 days

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5X_V81OYnQ

First thing I'll do is get an app running (window)

This looks good
https://www.appcoda.com/learnuikit/build-your-first-app.html

Man my 2015 MBP is strugglin ha

So I got my window up, it's pre-built for you

I'm going with SwiftUI vs. Storyboard

Look at this Apple provides nice docs

https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui

Probably should follow this so I'm not just flailing around trying to figure this out, need to be productive

Tomorrow I need to actually try the lidar stuff IRL, the usecase for me is to prove/figure out the perspective/beam aiming issue from a camera

I want to measure the item of interest eg. an orange box and show its dimensions as I move closer/away from it

The dimension should stay the same but the item gets bigger/smaller

A first app though is a timer notification for my Mac

It's basic like "remind me 20 mins, unplug charger"

Also could rewrite my cross platform ElectronJS app with Swift for mac case to further enforce the knowledge

Idk... Godot is on my mind too

Be nice to just stick with one, I'm not much of a Mac user other than if a job requires it

Anyway let me follow through with this tutorial, won't write it here, will write it in my personal notes

Damn there's a lot

9:26 AM

10:06 AM

Making good progress, I'm going to skip the prettying stuff just get the basics down of how to build something

10:29 AM

I should note I'm not really 100% following this tutorial, so my end result may be broken/not matching what the tutorial has.

I'm just learning the gist of things

For example I skipped mapkit

10:35 AM

getting distracted, learning is not fun, I'd rather build, find out

I might do a fun project later on, free form/free style, it's JS related

A chrome extension that brings things up to my attention

Reminders, things I was looking at

These suck because when you inject content into a dom on any website, they could potentially pick up the changes/store it but idk... it's a nicer UI experience than the drop down from the CE icon click which is secure

It would be nice if you could somehow encrypt that layer and while it would be readable visually you could not figure out what it said from the DOM

A picture would work but the picture itself would give away the info

Maybe an injected iframe

That would be some work though, iframe, https, prep the info, at this point it could just be plain text

I'll work on finishing this tutorial set then I'll work on that

It's all part of my unified notetaking/self learning/improving/organizaing thing

10:53 AM

Alright will take a snack break soon but need to get back to this, focus on the tutorial

hmm I'm getting antsy, want to build something

11:13 AM break to do something else briefly

12:36 PM well I definitely got sidetracked

I'll work on finishing this section for today

https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation

Ehh... I gotta stop here

There is an important step to learn next, the jumping from one view to another

I'm losing interest/thinking of other things
