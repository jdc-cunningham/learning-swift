Ahh... whole day just for me...

At this point I have not made anything with swift yet, I just did this hour long tutorial on Swift fundamentals over 4 days

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5X_V81OYnQ

First thing I'll do is get an app running (window)

This looks good

Man my 2015 MBP is strugglin ha

So I got my window up, it's pre-built for you

I'm going with SwiftUI vs. Storyboard

Look at this Apple provides nice docs

https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui

Probably should follow this so I'm not just flailing around trying to figure this out, need to be productive

Tomorrow I need to actually try the lidar stuff IRL, the usecase for me is to prove/figure out the perspective/beam aiming issue from a camera

I want to measure the item of interest eg. an orange box and show its dimensions as I move closer/away from it

The dimension should stay the same but the item gets bigger/smaller

A first app though is a timer notification for my Mac

It's basic like "remind me 20 mins, unplug charger"

Also could rewrite my cross platform ElectronJS app with Swift for mac case to further enforce the knowledge

Idk... Godot is on my mind too

Be nice to just stick with one, I'm not much of a Mac user other than if a job requires it

Anyway let me follow through with this tutorial, won't write it here, will write it in my personal notes

Damn there's a lot
